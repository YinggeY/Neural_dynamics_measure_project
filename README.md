# Neural_dynamics_measure_project
Neural dynamics of Lempel-Ziv measure in different alertness states with auditory tasks

The project will be divided into three parts:

1. MATLAB/Python codes for calculating regional Lempel-Ziv measure.
2. Post-processing on CSV/Excel generated and distribution/correlation plots.
3. Multi-level modelling R codes.

Important Note: the Lempel-Ziv LZ76 was implemented by Prof. Mediano (https://github.com/pmediano/EntRate) and used in this project, thanks to him.

It may seems a bit messy now, but I will tidy up and cluster these codes based on their functionality and adaptibility soon (within 1 or 2 weeks). New functions on correlation analysis of LZ change in six brain regions examining drowsiness level will also come out soon.
